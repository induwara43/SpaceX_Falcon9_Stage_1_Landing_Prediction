## Introduction

SpaceX, founded by Elon Musk, has revolutionized the aerospace industry with its reusable rocket technology. One of the critical aspects of SpaceX's missions is the safe landing of the Falcon 9 rocket stage 1. This project focuses on predicting the success of Falcon 9 landings using machine learning algorithms.

## Data Collection

Data for this project is collected from the SpaceX API, providing information about Falcon 9 launches, landings, and other relevant details. Additionally, data is scraped from Wikipedia pages to enrich the dataset with additional features.

## Data Wrangling

The collected data undergoes extensive data wrangling to clean and preprocess it for analysis. This includes handling missing values, converting data types, and combining data from multiple sources.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is conducted to gain insights into the dataset and understand the relationships between different variables. Visualizations using libraries such as seaborn, matplotlib, folium, and plotly are employed to visualize the data.

## Machine Learning

Several machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), decision trees, and support vector machines (SVM), are applied to predict the safe landing of Falcon 9 rocket stage 1. Grid search and cross-validation techniques are used to tune hyperparameters and evaluate model performance.

## Results

The results of the machine learning models are analyzed and compared to determine the most effective approach for predicting Falcon 9 landings. Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to evaluate the models.
